There is no difference between the original image
and the reconstructed image.
Use of integral image is to know about the gradient
of the image.
If at some portion of the image, there is a very sharp
contrast in the lighting, then it reflects out in the
integral image.
SURF detector makes use of the gradient between regions.
Therefore, integral image helps in faster calculation of
subregion sums and speeds up the feature detection process.
